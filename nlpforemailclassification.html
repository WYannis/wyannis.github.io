                    <h1>NLP: identify which writing style performs best for hotels' marketing
                        emails</h1>
                </header>

                <p>As part of my masters' thesis, I was given the opportunity to work with <a
                        href="https://for-sight.com" style="font-weight: bold">For-Sight</a>, a
                    hospitality-focused
                    CRM platform based in Edinburgh. They provide numerous hotels with digital and analytical tools that
                    allow them to
                    track
                    the engagement and efficacy of their marketing campaigns. In particular, e-mails remain the
                    privileged communication channel between hotels and their clients and hotels are looking
                    to optimize their communication to drive strong customer engagement. For this purpose, I
                    was tasked to work on a text analysis tool that will categorize e-mails, assess the marketing
                    performance of each category and make it possible for hotels to adapt their strategy.</p>
                <p>I developed a <b>dual classification method</b> that combines two common subgenre of text
                    classification
                    problems. The first model designed is a <b>formality classifier</b>, which computes a quantitative
                    measure
                    of how formal a text is - given the features of that text. This model was trained and tested on the
                    <a href="https://github.com/raosudha89/GYAFC-corpus">Grammarly Yahoo Answers</a> corpus composed of
                    110 000 sentences, and then applied onto the e-mails. The
                    usage of an outside corpus as an intermediate to tune the formality classifier was mandatory, as it
                    is a supervised learning method that logically requires pre-labelling of the text, and the manual
                    labelling of e-mails would have been too laborious.</p>
                <p>The second model is a <b>sentiment analysis classifier</b>, which aims at adding an extra layer on
                    top of
                    the formality class. It is capable of grasping the polarity of the
                    words used <i>(positive/negative)</i> and the tone in writing. It was trained and tested on a
                    Twitter
                    database composed of 40
                    000 tweets conveying different feelings. In
                    total, four classes of sentiments have been used in this study: <i>[‚ÄòSERIOUS‚Äô, ‚ÄòHAPPY‚Äô, ‚ÄòFUN‚Äô,
                        ‚ÄòCARING‚Äô]</i>.
                    Although marketing e-mails are mostly stripped of any strong sentiments, there are perceivable
                    differences in the way hotels with different strategies
                    interact with their clients.</p>
                <span class="image main"><img src="images/dual_classification_model.png" alt=""/></span>

                <p>Applied together, those models constitute a classification that is detailed enough to
                    bring interesting insights to the marketing teams in the hospitality business. The results of the
                    application on the dual model on an e-mails database of partners hotels from For-Sight indicate that
                    it is capable of accurately grasping the preferences of each hotel‚Äôs clientele. It effectively
                    allows hotel to adapt their
                    communication style depending on the customer engagement metrics showcased by each writing
                    style. </p>

                <h2>Formality classifier</h2>
                <p>The formality classifier is a Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes model. It takes the numerical representation of
                    a sentence as input and returns the probability that the sentence belongs into the "Formal" or
                    "Informal" class.</p>
                <p>To represent a sentence numerically the best set of features was found to be a set of 6 linguistic
                    statistics, which are described below.</p>
                 <div class="table-wrapper">

                                        lowercase

                                    <li>binary indicator for whether the first word is capitalized</li>

                                    <li>number of contractions in the sentence</li>
                                    <li>average word length</li>
                                </ul>

                            <td><b>Punctuation:</b> number of "? ; ‚Ä¶ ! " in the sentence</td>
                        </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, to compute a formality score at e-mail level, we need to consider an e-mail as an ensemble
                    of
                    sentences. The formality score that will be computed for each e-mail is the weighted average of the
                    probabilities of its sentences being formal. In mathematical terms, for an e-mail of length ùêø
                    characters, made of ùëõ sentences, the formality score ùêπ is:</p>
                <p>\[ F=\sum_{i=1}^{n}P(sentence_i=formal)\times \frac{len(sentence_i)}{L} \]</p>

                <h2>Sentiment classifier</h2>
                <p> For the sentiment classifier model, I combined <b>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</b> and <b>Long-Short
                    Term
                    Memory (LSTM) networks</b> that are common models found in the literature. Feeding as input into
                    those models, the words from the emails were turned into a numerical array thanks to the
                    <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/"> GloVe word embeddings</a>. More specifically, I
                    used the 200-dimensions GloVe vectors that were trained
                    on a corpus of 27 billion tweets (most suited to our case of use since we are also working on
                    tweets). It is one of the best performing embeddings and was introduced in 2014 by <i>Pennington et
                        al.</i>
                    from Stanford University.</p>
                <p>The intuition behind using CNNs on text relies on the fact that text is structured and organized; As
                    such, we can expect a CNN model to discover and learn patterns that would otherwise be lost in a
                    classic
                    feedforward network that do not include the filtering step. For example, it might be able to
                    distinguish that
                    using <i>"down"</i> in the context of <i>"down to earth"</i> is actually of positive sentiment as
                    opposed
                    to other
                    phrases such as <i>"feeling down"</i>. Furthermore, it will be able to extract these features
                    regardless of where they
                    occur in the sentence.</p>
                <p>Long-Short Term Memory networks are a type of Recurrent Neural Network architecture that is
                    designed to remember previously read values for any given period of time. LSTMs usually contain
                    three gates that control the flow to and from their memories. The <i>‚Äúinput gate"</i> controls the
                    input of new information to the memory. The <i>‚Äúforget gate"</i> controls how long certain values
                    are held in memory. Finally, the <i>‚Äúoutput gate"</i> controls how much the value stored in memory
                    affects the output activation of the block. Intuitively, the benefit of using LSTMs when doing any
                    type of text analysis is that the network will remember what it has read previously, and thus is
                    can have a better understanding of the input.</p>
                <p>The final architecture of the model deployed to classify sentiments is :
                <ul>
                    <li>Initialize 1 LSTM layer with the embeddings obtained from GloVe vectors: this layer is supposed
                        to remain with frozen weights to conserve the information of the pre-trained GloVe vectors.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add a second LSTM layer with empty embeddings which weights will get adjusted by the information
                        extracted from the training phase.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add 5 CNN layers, each of them having 20 filters. We use the L2 norm as regularization metric
                        and the ReLu function as activation function.
                    </li>
                    <li>The final layers are a MaxPooling layer and a final fully-connected
                        layer that creates a 4-dimension output with a softmax activation function, each of those
                        dimensions indicating the probability of belonging to one of the four sentiments SERIOUS, HAPPY,
                        FUN and CARING.
                    </li>
                </ul>
